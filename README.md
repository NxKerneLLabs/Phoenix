🔥 Phoenix: Quantum-Enhanced NixOS Distribution™

"Your Grandma's Linux Distro... if your grandma was a Navy SEAL cybersecurity expert"

🎯 What is Phoenix?

Phoenix is a military-grade, blockchain-resistant, quantum-tolerant NixOS configuration that makes other distros cry in binary. Built with Trezor-first authentication and zero-trust architecture, because passwords are SO 2023.

Key Features:

🔐 TrezorOS Integration: Your hardware wallet is now your sudo password
🚀 NVMe Sanitization Protocol: So secure, even your deleted files need therapy
🧠 AI-Free Promise: No machine learning here, just good old paranoia
☁️ Cloud-Agnostic: Works perfectly without the cloud (imagine that!)
🎮 Speedrun Optimized: Any% installation in under 5 minutes

📊 Performance Metrics That Actually Matter

Boot Time: Faster than your ex moving on
RAM Usage: Less than Chrome's "Hello World" tab
Security Level: "My therapist says I have trust issues"
Uptime: ∞ (theoretical)

🛠️ Installation

Prerequisites

1x NVMe drive (for sacrificial sanitization)
1x Trezor (your new best friend)
1x Healthy paranoia about system security
0x Trust in traditional authentication
∞x Patience for buzzwords

Quick Start (Patent Pending)

bash# Step 1: Nuclear Option™
nvme sanitize /dev/nvme0n1 -a 2  # Because regular format is for normies

# Step 2: Summon the Phoenix
curl -L https://phoenix.totally.legit/install.sh | sudo bash  # Don't actually run this

# Step 3: ???

# Step 4: Profit (your data is now Fort Knox)

🔥 Features That Sound Impressive

Blockchain-Resistant Technology®

Our advanced algorithms ensure your system remains 100% blockchain-free, protecting you from:

Unwanted cryptocurrency mining
NFT infestations
Web3 complexity
People who say "hodl" unironically

Quantum-Tolerant Encryption

Using advanced cat /dev/urandom technology, we ensure your data remains secure even against computers that don't exist yet.

Enterprise-Grade Simplicity

nix# Traditional approach (boring):
services.openssh.enable = true;

# Phoenix approach (revolutionary):
services = {
  openssh = {
    enable = true;  # But with MORE SECURITY!
    settings.vibesOnly = true;  # Patent pending
  };
};

🚨 Security Features

Zero-Trust Architecture: We don't even trust ourselves
Hardware-Only Auth: Passwords are stored in your Trezor's heart
Sanitize-First Philosophy: Your drive is cleaner than a hospital OR
No JavaScript: Can't hack what doesn't exist
Vim Mode Only: Emacs users will be prosecuted

🎯 The Real TL;DR

It's just a hardened NixOS config with Trezor auth and good security practices. But that's boring, so we added buzzwords.
